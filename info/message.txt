1) Product Overview

Senpai Career is a membership-based platform for international students in Japan.

Core concept:

Start with OB/OG (alumni) career interviews (mentoring / consultation)

Then connect to long-term internships and new graduate recruiting

Enable companies to search students and send paid scout DMs (credit-based)

Positioning (from slides):

Not “regular hiring” first — Senpai Career creates a “try-first entry point”
Keywords: low risk / start small / step-by-step

Primary CTA messaging ideas:

“Give international students a fair start line for job hunting”

“Start accepting international interns with low risk”

“Free consultation” CTA exists in slides (contact: info@senpaicareer.com
)

10) MVP Scope (your suggested minimal build)

Your MVP proposal aligns well with client’s core needs:

Public LP → registration funnel

Auth + role-based permissions (Student/OB/OG/Company)

Profile creation/edit

Listing + search/filter (critical)

1:1 messaging

Report + minimal admin review screen (safety baseline)

(Everything else can be phased: notifications personalization, mutual reviews, credit payments, bulk messaging, etc.)

11) Slide-based supporting content (for LP / marketing)

Useful messages to incorporate in design/copy:

Hiring is hard: labor shortage + limited channels + lack of know-how

“Casual hiring experience”: try first, confirm fit through work

Market is moving: international white-collar hiring increasing

International students often join smaller companies → “early access advantage”

Add-on services: training + monthly check

Training-only: 3h from ¥40,000

Monthly ops check: ¥3,000 per intern

“Start with 1 intern” model: deposit + success fee after 1 month

Traction data (self-reported):

Registered students: N=63 (as of Dec 2025)

Keio 31 / Ritsumeikan 19 / Waseda 6 / Univ. of Tokyo 6

12) Open Questions / Decisions Needed (for the client)

To finalize build scope and estimate, confirm:

Exact MVP phase: which of these are included now?

notifications + personalization

mutual reviews

bulk messaging

credit payment + Stripe integration

Meeting scheduling: “inside chat” only, or calendar booking feature?

Contact exchange rule: “generally prohibited” → define allowed exception cases (if any)

Data privacy: can admins view message content, or only metadata?

Multi-language UI requirements (JP only? EN/others?)

Legal pages: terms / privacy policy copy provided by client or drafted by you?
